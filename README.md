## Connect Four

An exercise in test driven development, this is a basic version of the classic Connect Four game on the command line. Two players can select which column on the game board to drop their token, alternating turns. First player to connect four tokens consecutively (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal configurations) wins the game.
